# What is Machine Learning?

## Different from algorithms
### common
* for solve problems
* base on math
### Difference
* A set of examples(Data) is provided
* "trained" to solve the problem
* meta-approach

## Machine Learning Progress
### What we must decide before training
1. decide/design a hypothesis set(model)
2. decide a loss function
3. decide a optimization

### After decide
1. For each hypothesis set, find best models - using training set
2. Among the trained models, select the best one using vaildation loss
3. Report how well the best model would work

## Neural Net
* Directed cyclic graph(DAG)
